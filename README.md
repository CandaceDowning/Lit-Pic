## Lit-Pic

### A side project

Still in the beginning phases! I wanted to see what it would take to recreate a childhood favorite; Lite Brite! The original toy had 1735 holes, but as a proof of concept I started with 100 inputs, but have bumped it up to 900! I hope to expand this project to allow more inputs, and offset every other row of inputs to more accurately simulate the original game.

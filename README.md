## Lit-Pic

### A side project

Still in the prototype phase, but I wanted to see what it would take to recreate a childhood favorite; Lite Brite! The original toy had 1735 holes, but as a proof of concept I started with 100 inputs but have expanded it up to 900. I hope to expand this project to allow variable numbers of inputs based on screen size, offset every other row of inputs to more accurately simulate the original game, and to polish the UI.
